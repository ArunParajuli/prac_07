## Key Lessons Learned About Clean Code
- **Consistency:** Maintaining consistent coding style and conventions throughout the project improves readability and makes it easier for others to understand and contribute to the codebase.
- **Simplicity:** Keeping code simple and concise helps reduce complexity and makes it easier to debug and maintain in the long run.
- **Documentation:** Writing clear and concise documentation, including comments and docstrings, helps others understand the purpose and functionality of the code without having to dive into the implementation details.
